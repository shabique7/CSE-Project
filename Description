# Mobile Banking System in C 💰💻  

## 📌 Overview  

The **Mobile Banking System in C** is a **console-based banking application** that allows users to **perform essential banking operations** securely. The program mimics a **real-world banking experience**, enabling users to **send money, add funds, check their balance, recharge mobile numbers, and cash out money** with PIN verification for security.  

This project was developed using **C programming** and utilizes **loops, conditionals, and user input handling** to create a smooth user experience. The system ensures **security** by requiring users to **enter a correct 4-digit PIN** before performing any sensitive transaction.

## 💡 Motivation  

The purpose of this project is to **simulate a basic banking system** and demonstrate how C programming can be used to build real-world applications. It is a great **learning project** for beginners who want to understand:  

✔️ **Menu-driven programs** using loops and conditionals  
✔️ **Secure user input handling** (PIN verification)  
✔️ **Basic banking logic** (transactions, balance updates)  
✔️ **Error handling** to prevent invalid transactions  

This project **does not use databases**, so it operates **in-memory**—meaning all data resets when the program is restarted. Future improvements can integrate **file handling or databases** for persistent data storage.
